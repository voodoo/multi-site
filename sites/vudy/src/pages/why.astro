  <h1>Why Vudy?</h1>

  <article class="content">
    <h2>One Complete Package</h2>
    <p>
      No guessing. No compromises. No "you need to buy this and that separately." 
      We give you everything: 32kWh of LFP batteries, 800W of solar, and a complete electrical system. 
      One package. One price. Done.
    </p>

    <h2>Built by Someone Who Gets It</h2>
    <p>
      Vudy isn't owned by a corporation. It's built by someone who believes in energy independence. 
      Someone who understands what it means to own your own power. That changes everything.
    </p>

    <h2>LFP Technology, Not Outdated Lead-Acid</h2>
    <p>
      Old lead-acid batteries need constant maintenance, waste energy, and die after 5-7 years. 
      LFP is different. It's safer, more efficient, and lasts 20+ years. We use the best technology available.
    </p>

    <h2>32kWh Is Real Power</h2>
    <p>
      32kWh isn't a marketing number. It's enough to power an average household for a full day 
      (depending on usage). Combined with 800W of solar, you have a system that works year-round.
    </p>

    <h2>800W Solar Is Proven</h2>
    <p>
      Not oversized marketing. Not undersized penny-pinching. 800W solar is the sweet spot: 
      It charges your 32kWh battery reliably while being cost-effective and installable on most properties.
    </p>

    <h2>Professional Installation Included</h2>
    <p>
      We don't sell you hardware and wish you luck. We install it. We certify it. 
      We make sure it works. You get a system you can trust.
    </p>

    <h2>Long-Term Support</h2>
    <p>
      10-year warranty. Annual maintenance. 24/7 support. We're here when you need us. 
      This isn't a one-time transaction—it's a relationship.
    </p>

    <h2>Energy Independence Actually Works</h2>
    <p>
      With Vudy, you stop paying electricity bills. You stop depending on the grid. 
      You generate your own power. You store it. You use it. That's freedom.
    </p>

    <h2>Simple. Direct. Honest.</h2>
    <p>
      No upselling. No complicated financing. No hidden fees. One package. One price. 
      Everything you need. Nothing you don't.
